# pycommons: Common Utility Functions for Python Projects.

Some common utility functionality for Python projects.

## 1. Introduction

In this project, we combine several utilities and functions that are used in our other projects.

These functions have in common that they are fail-fast.
They usually check the types of all of their inputs and raise exceptions immediately if something looks dodgy.
There is no garbage-in/garbage-out:
Our functions raise descriptive errors as soon as they detect something strange.


## 2. Installation

In order to use this package, you need to first install it using [`pip`](https://pypi.org/project/pip/) or some other tool that can install packages from [PyPi](https://pypi.org).
You can install the newest version of this library from [PyPi](https://pypi.org/project/pycommons/) using [`pip`](https://pypi.org/project/pip/) by doing

```shell
pip install pycommons
```

This will install the latest official release of our package as well as [all dependencies](https://thomasweise.github.io/pycommons/requirements.html).
If you want to install the latest source code version from GitHub (which may not yet be officially released), you can do

```shell
pip install git+https://github.com/thomasWeise/pycommons.git
```

If you want to install the latest source code version from GitHub (which may not yet be officially released) and you have set up a private/public key for GitHub, you can also do:

```shell
git clone ssh://git@github.com/thomasWeise/pycommons
pip install pycommons
```

This may sometimes work better if you are having trouble reaching GitHub via `https` or `http`.

You can also clone the repository and then run a [`make` build](https://thomasweise.github.io/pycommons/Makefile.html), which will automatically install all dependencies, run all the tests, and then install the package on your system, too.
This will work only on Linux, though.
It also installs the [dependencies for building](https://thomasweise.github.io/pycommons/requirements-dev.html), which include, e.g., those for unit testing and static analysis.
If this build completes successful, you can be sure that [`pycommons`](https://thomasweise.github.io/pycommons) will work properly on your machine.

All dependencies for using and running `pycommons` are listed at [here](https://thomasweise.github.io/pycommons/requirements.html).
The additional dependencies for a [full `make` build](https://thomasweise.github.io/pycommons/Makefile.html), including unit tests, static analysis, and the generation of documentation are listed [here](https://thomasweise.github.io/pycommons/requirements-dev.html).

## 3. Examples

### 3.1. Data Structures

```python
from pycommons.ds.cache import str_is_new

cache = str_is_new()
print(cache("1"))
print(cache("2"))
print(cache("1"))
print(cache("3"))
print(cache("2"))
```

prints `True`, `True`, `False`, `True`, and `False`.

```python
from pycommons.ds.immutable_map import immutable_mapping

imap = immutable_mapping({1: 2, 3: 4})
try:
    imap[1] = 3
except TypeError as te:
    print(te)

print(imap[1])
```

prints `'mappingproxy' object does not support item assignment` and `2`.
