# Dependencies Required to Use `pycommons`
#
# In this file we list all the libraries that are required to use `pycommons`.
# You must install them before using `pycommons`.
# If you install `pycommons` via pip, i.e., do `pip install pycommons`, then this
# is done automatically for you. Otherwise, you could do
# `pip install --no-input --timeout 360 --retries 100 -r requirements.txt`
# with a text file `requirements.txt` that has the exact same contents as this
# file here.
#
# `pycommons` is available at https://thomasweise.github.io/pycommons.
# This file is available at https://github.com/thomasWeise/pycommons.
#
# Below, we list each required library and specify the reason why it is
# needed. Notice that these libraries may, in turn, depend on other libraries.
# We cannot maintain a full list of these recursive dependencies.
# Here we only list the top-level dependencies that are actually used by
# `pycommons` directly.

# urllib3 and certifi are used to check the URLs in the [dev] extras variant
# of our package. They are used to check URL in markdown files.

certifi == 2026.1.4

# these static analysis tools are also needed for the [dev] extras variant

# sphinx is needed for generating the documentation. Together with its
# modules, it parses the documentation root file as well as the code and
# generates the html files with the documentation. It therefore uses the
# docstrings and the type hints.

# minify_html is needed to minify html output in the [dev] option.
# Our documentation is fairly large. We apply this tool to try to reduce the
# file size of the documentation, by, e.g., removing useless white space.
minify_html == 0.18.1

# We need pytest to run the unit tests.
# Unit tests test components of our package, e.g., functions or objects, and
# compare their behavior with the expected behaviors in some test cases.
# This helps spotting errors where code behaves differently from the
# expectation. Of course, unit tests cannot guarantee that there are no
# errors. But they can at least check whether our code behaves as it should in
# some usual or border cases. Also, they can help us find out if changes in
# the code lead to changes in (tested/expected) behavior.
