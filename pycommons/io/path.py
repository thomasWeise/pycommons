"""
The class `Path` for handling paths to files and directories.

The instances of :class:`Path` identify file system paths.
They are always fully canonicalized with all relative components resolved.
They thus allow the clear and unique identification of files and directories.
They also offer support for opening streams, creating paths to sub-folders,
and so on.

The first goal is to encapsulate the functionality of the :mod:`os.path`
module into a single class.
The second goal is to make sure that we do not run into any dodgy situation
with paths pointing to security-sensitive locations or something due to
strange `.` and `..` trickery.
If you try to resolve a path inside a directory and the resulting canonical
path is outside that directory, you get an error raised, for example.
