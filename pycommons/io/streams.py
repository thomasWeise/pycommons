"""
Streams for reading and writing of data.

When working with text files, we would usually open them as instances of
:class:`~io.TextIOBase`. However, we usually only need a tiny subset of what
these classes offer.
For example, when we open a text file for reading, usually, we just want to
iterate over its lines.
When opening a file for writing, usually, we just want to iteratively write
lines of text.
From this perspective, a text input stream is basically an interator of string
which returns the lines one-by-one.
A text output stream then basically is a function which accepts a string.
Whenever this function is called, it writes this string as line to the output.
This perspective has some intriguing effects: If a text file opened for
reading is indeed represented as iterator of strings, then the code processing
this iterator can as well accept other sources, such as lists,
*without needing any change*.
If a file opened for text output is indeed treated as `Callable[[str], Any]`,
then code writing to such a file can as well receive another such callable,
say, :func:`print`.
In other words, that works with this concept of text input and output will
become much more versatile and elegant.

However, there is one drawback: How can we close the streams once we are done
with them?
In this module, we try marry the :class:`typing.ContextManager` interface to
the iterator/`Callable` perspective.
In other words, it provides the above functionality in a way that uses
Python's magic of decorators, context managers, and generators to
automatically close the underlying text streams once the iterator or
`Callable` goes out of scope.
