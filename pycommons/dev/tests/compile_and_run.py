    Compile and run some code for testing purposes.

    This method first checks the types of its parameters.
    It then performs some  superficial sanity checks on `code`.
    Then, it changes the working directory to a temporary folder which is
    deleted after all work is done.
    It then compiles and, if that was successful, executes the code fragment.
    Then working directory is changed back to the original directory and the
    temporary directory is deleted.

    :param code: the code to be compiled and run
    :param source: the source of the code
    :raises TypeError: if `code` or `source` are not strings
    :raises ValueError: if any parameter has an invalid value
        or if the code execution fails
